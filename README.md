# <h1>Predicting Survival on the Titanic 🚢💡</h1>
This repository contains a data analysis and machine learning project aimed at predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The project uses the famous Titanic dataset to analyze survival patterns and build a predictive model using Python.<br>

</h2>Overview 📋</h2><br>
When the Titanic sank, it resulted in a tragic loss of life. However, historical data from the disaster provides valuable insights into factors that influenced survival, such as age, gender, ticket class, and family size.<br>

This project explores the Titanic dataset to:<br>
<b>
Analyze the survival patterns through data visualization.<br>
Build predictive models to estimate the chances of survival for passengers.<br>
</b>

<h2>Features 🛠️</h2>

<b>Data Analysis:</b><br>
Explore and clean the Titanic dataset.<br>
Understand the correlations between different features (e.g., gender, age, class) and survival.<br>
Use visualizations to uncover insights.<br>

<b>Machine Learning Models:</b><br>
Implement and compare models such as:<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Random Forest<br>
Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>
Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)<br>
Optimize models using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.<br>

<b>Evaluation Metrics:</b><br>
Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>

<h2>Dataset 📊</h2>

The project uses the Titanic Dataset from Kaggle. It includes information about passengers such as:<br>

Survived: 0 = No, 1 = Yes<br>
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)<br>
Name, Age, Sex: Demographic details<br>
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard<br>
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard<br>
Fare: Ticket fare price <br>
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)<br>

<h2>Project Workflow 🔄</h2>

<b>Data Preprocessing:</b><br>
Handle missing values (e.g., filling missing ages and embarked values).<br>
Convert categorical variables (e.g., gender, embarked) into numerical form.<br>

<b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</b><br>
Visualize survival rates across different passenger classes, genders, and other features.<br>
Identify key factors influencing survival.<br>

<b>Modeling:</b><br>
Train machine learning models on the dataset.<br>
Evaluate and compare models to choose the best performer.<br>

<b>Prediction:</b><br>
Use the trained model to predict survival for unseen passengers.<br>
